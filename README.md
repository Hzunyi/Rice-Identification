4.The slove.py is the master model,it use to change the different model like as Deeplab, U-Net, FCN et.al. And you can use the code to train all model.
5.The SegDataFolder.py is to processing data. Which include channel data, mean and std. If you want to train new data, you should pay attention on the channel data and the value of mean and std.
6. The getSetting.py is to change the hyper-parameter such as optimizer, scheduler, criterion, backbone et.al.
